# What is Money Leash?

Money Leash is a Personal Expense App ~~developed~~ being developed in Ionic, AngularJS, and Firebase.

I discovered the Ionic Framework back in April 2015 and I became addicted almost immediately. This app is a work in 
progress and the result of the itch I had to get out of my comfort zone and experiment with new technologies. Money Leash 
will stay as an **open source** project so **your feedback and help would be greatly appreciated!**

Ultimate goal? To bring it to Apple's App Store and Google Play.
